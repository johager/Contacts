# Contacts

This is the fifth self-assessment project for the Devmountain iOS App Developer Bootcamp.

The app tracks contacts and has a list of contacts and a detail view for a contact. Data is persisted using CloudKit.


Additions to the baseline project:

- The UI is created programmatically: Interface Builder isn't used.
- There is a firstName and a lastName instead of just a name.
- The contacts are sorted by "lastName, firstName".
- The Save button is only active if the contact can be created or updated.
- Comprehensive error reporting through a UIAlertController.
